# Propane Language

Propane is a language designed to simplify network configuration. It translates high-level network policy into low-level configurations for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that run in a completely distributed manner. The compiler guarantees that the resulting configurations correctly implement the specified policy under all possible combinations of failures.
